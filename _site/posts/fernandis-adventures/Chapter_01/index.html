		<p>My name is Bob. This is the story of my friend, Fernandi.</p>
<p>All day long, Fernandi did nothing, but roam around the depths of the streets on his trusty motorcycle with almost no clothes on. Fernandi enjoyed the fresh breeze as he zoomed around the city performing odd activities. Overall, Fernandi was a weird person. He jumped off cliffs with no parachute for fun, partied all night, and had a diet consisting of only chicken nuggets, granola bars, milk, and alcohol. The list of Fernandi’s bizarre habits could go on and on.  However, one day, Fernandi’s life flipped upside-down (and inside-out).</p>
<p>It all started when Fernandi decided to choose the sweet and sour sauce instead of the usual BBQ for his chicken nugget dip. Before Fernandi could even take a nibble of his crispy, spicy, and new chicken nugget, it blew up in it face. The explosion blew Fernandi off his feet into a pile of trash where he was smothered in leftover fast-food. In front of him, there stood a man in an extremely ridiculous chicken nugget outfit. Despite the silly costume, the man emitted power and royalty.</p>
<p>Fernandi yelled in a dazed voice, “Hey, what did you do to my lunch? And where did you get that awesome crown? ”</p>
<p>The man announced, “I am so sorry my friend. I can only transport to different worlds through chicken nuggets. Oh, and I got this crown from Burger King.” He handed the paper crown to Fernandi as he looked at it with wonder. Then, the man coughed, “Anyway, the reason for my presence is to announce you as my knight. Because, I, the Chicken Nugget King III, have issued you a quest. Accept this luxurious quest and behold unlimited riches and a beautiful princess,” he proclaimed “Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle cramps, life or death situations and other side effects may occur” he added laser fast. The chicken nugget king smiled persuasively like a commercial advertiser.</p>
<p>Fernandi, who was still analyzing in awe of the newly-acquired crown, shrugged, “Sure,” not knowing what he was getting himself into.</p>
<p>“Wonderful!” the chicken nugget king beamed and he snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>Instantly, Fernandi found himself face to face to a fiery, hot phoenix. The phoenix was gulping down green beans and then stared at Fernandi eagerly, as if he was dessert. Then, the not-so nice phoenix roared fire onto Fernandi’s delicate and naked body. Fernandi shrieked like a girl and tried to zip away on his motorcycle. Desperately, Fernandi threw a bottle of vodka at the phoenix. The phoenix erupted into larger flames and enraged it only further.</p>
<p>Fernandi gulped, “I don’t think that worked.” The phoenix glared at the nude person and charged at Fernandi with its fiery claws. Before Fernandi could register that he was facing imminent death, Fernandi sneezed and slipped at the same time, barely missing the deadly sharp claws. As a result, the phoenix smashed into a big tree behind Fernandi and died. Fernandi celebrated his victory by getting a bottle of whisky. Then he fainted.</p>
<p>THE END for now…</p>
