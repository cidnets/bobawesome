		<p>The two friends quickly got out of their unresponsive traumatized state (so they technically did faint while standing) and started <s>running</s> sprinting for their lives (maybe faster) and leaving a trail of wet liquid behind them. Never in their whole entire life have they ever seen such a horrid monster. Picture it like this, imagine all of the evil, scary, frightening things you can think of, add a billion more monsters and evilness to that, then multiply the fear factor by a million and quadruple the size of the monster. Next, imagine it is standing next to you as it breathed pure terror onto your paralyzed mind and body. If you didn’t get immediate heart attack, consider yourself unlucky. Death is the easiest part. Anyway, Fernandi galloped through the (not-so) creepy forest like a cheetah on steroids, oblivious to the fact that he left poor Ryan far behind. Ryan was running pretty fast for a turtle, but he was doomed.</p>
<p>In desperation, Ryan screamed, “Help me, Fernandi!” Fernandi stood in a dilemma. He could go back and most likely die with Ryan or keep running with a small chance of escaping and losing a good friend. Fernandi chose the first one. With pure determination (mixed with few tons of pure fright), Fernandi charged into the darkness to save the hopeless turtle. Then when he got a good look at the monster, he almost went through a stroke. Fernandi swallowed back his fear (and some throw up) and picked up the frozen turtle. Then he noticed that Ryan was frozen.</p>
<p>Then, the monster croaked a horrendous voice freezing Fernandi in place, “Your friend is frozen my dear. And you are too. Your fear is filling me up quite well.” Then it started laughing maniacally which deafened Fernandi.</p>
<p>“My name is Alojandra! I am the meaning of fear!” as the monster showed her full self. Fernandi didn’t even have time to groan as he fainted in a frozen position. Fully knowing that if he fainted, it would cause all his friends and himself to die, Fernandi fainted.</p>
<p><em>Is this the end of Fernandi’s Adventures? Stay tuned for the next chapter!</em></p>
