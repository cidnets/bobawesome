		<p>The next morning, Fernandi woke up feeling slightly dizzy and tired, but compared to other days, he was as fit as a bull. Everyone else felt the same too and was ready to kick some magician (or enchantress or minions) butt. After a big breakfast of containing of only cottage cheese, Fernandi and the others continued on their journey. As they merrily skipped along the paths, they suddenly halted to a stop. In front of them laid a barren landscape of pure snow and coldness. They turned around and saw that only this particular section was covered in unnaturally abundant amount of snow.</p>
<p>David stared at the snow looking puzzled, “I didn’t know this place had snow. I didn’t even know snow existed in Ozland!?” The friends looked nervously at their confused guide.</p>
<p>“Oh, what’s the harm of a little snow? Let’s go!” David said as he turned on his snow mode of his wheelchair. The weary friends put on their coats and trekked up the frigid land. At first, besides the cold air and harsh winds, the group was fine. This was until an Abominable Snowman popped out of a tree scaring the bejigles out of the group. They scrambled for cover as the creature threw deadly snowballs at them. One of the snowballs unfortunately hit Fernandi right in a sensitive spot causing him to groan painfully as he face planted into the snow. Another snowball rammed Bill into a tree making him go unconscious. Ryan tried to crawl away, but the monster just picked him up and threw him into the fog. This made David the last man standing (he was actually sitting). Fernandi was writhing in pain on the ground (it was a hard snowball), Bill laid unconscious as he muttered about bananas, and Ryan was lost somewhere in the midst of the vast snow.</p>
<p>“You’re going down!” David yelled as he pressed the turbo button. The surprised Abominable Snowman got rammed into the stomach before he could even react. Unfortunately, the wheelchair ran out of gas and David looked at the raving monster nervously. “Can I at least try to run away?” David whimpered. The creature smiled at David wickedly and raised his fist, ready to smash David into pieces. Then, out of nowhere, a bolt of energy knocked down the huge monster.</p>
<p>“You guys can’t go anywhere without me, can you?” Trish said as she continued to pummel the hopeless monster.</p>
<p>After shooting a series of lasers, the Abominable Snowman ran away crying, “The Evil Enchantress of the East will send the penguins to eat your bones!”</p>
<p>“You can thank me later. Here, take this,” as she clipped an earpiece to the limping Fernandi, “This way, you will never lose it again. Just call if you need help! Izrael might come instead of me though. Bye!” She flew away leaving the friends in the cold.</p>
<p>“Um, where’s Ryan anyway?” Fernandi asked.</p>
<p>“Here...” whispered a raspy voice from behind them. The friends pulled him off the ground and celebrated their success with some iced beer. They all fainted.</p>
