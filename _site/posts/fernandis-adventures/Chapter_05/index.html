		<p>Fernandi and Ryan woke up and started barfing. They had too much beer last night. After vomiting everything out, they drove off to their destination. Fernandi then noticed that he was really hungry after throwing up everything. He even didn’t have any chicken nuggets or granola bars left. Luckily, he saw a diner nearby. It was named Auntie M’s Diner. Both were lured in by a luscious smell of food and drinks. They staggered in while an old lady with a hairnet greeted them.</p>
<p>“Hi, take a seat!” she hissed to the mesmerized customers.</p>
<p>“I would like to have five triple cheeseburgers, and 10 extra-large crazy fries, 200 chicken nuggets, and 20 cans of Coke and beer.” said Fernandi while Ryan nodded. “Oh, and 15 more extra-large crazy fries for the turtle.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” said the lady while licking her lips. Fernandi then sat on the counter waiting for their food. Once Fernandi sat down, he noticed how there were so many potato statues of real figures around them. The potato statues were so intricate and real-looking that Fernandi almost couldn’t tell if they were statues or not (ignoring the fact that they were made of potatoes). However, the feature that stood out the most was the face. Instead of happy and cheerful, the faces portrayed horror and terror.</p>
<p>“So, how do you make potato statues?” said Fernandi, trying to start a conversation.</p>
<p>“By frying them sweetie” cackled the wrinkly lady.</p>
<p>“Um. What is your real name?” Fernandi questioned nervously.</p>
<p>“You don’t want to know,” screeched the creepy lady as she ripped off her hairnet (showing her live potato snakes) and leaped at Fernandi.</p>
<p>“Duck and close your eyes!” yelled Fernandi.</p>
<p>“Oh, I see we have met the eye-petrifying gorgon, Medusa, from Greek Mythology,” Ryan squeaked as he nibbled on a potato statue.</p>
<p>“Stop eating potatoes and run!” Fernandi screamed. They dashed for the door.</p>
<p>Medusa jumped in front of them and cried maniacally “Uh, uh, uh! Open your eyes and look at me before you leave! Smile too!”</p>
<p>“Open your eyes already!” Medusa screamed as she kicked Ryan across the room. In 10 seconds of furious rage, Fernandi blindly leaped at Medusa ripping off the potato snakes and snarfing them down like a rabid dog. Medusa evaporated.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” Ryan said, “but I think I lost my appetite.”</p>
<p>“Really?” Fernandi said</p>
<p>“No,” Ryan chuckled as they raided the diner eating everything in sight (even the statues). In the end, they got really stuffed and puked. They drank some root beer to fill up the emptiness in their stomachs (no beer). They fainted.</p>
