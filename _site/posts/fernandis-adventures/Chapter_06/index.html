		<p>After waking up with a bad case of diarrhea, Fernandi and Ryan continued on their journey. Before they could get far, they were stopped by the chicken nugget king.</p>
<p>After introducing Ryan to the king, he said, “Fernandi, I have a small detour from your adventure. I need you to go into this portal to fetch me some magic chicken nuggets I dropped. You’ll get unlimited beer as a reward.” Fernandi jumped in without hesitation.</p>
<p>As the portal closed, the chicken nugget king morphed into a dark robe. Fernandi yelped, “Wait you’re not the chicken nugget king.”</p>
<p>“That’s right! I’m the Dark Magician and I have tricked you. Now you’ll never escape and save the princess! Hahahaha!” yelled the evil guy happily.</p>
<p>“What’s your real name and get us out of here you dumbo?!” screamed Fernandi in defiance as he tried to jump out.</p>
<p>“My name is Alejandri!” cackled the Dark Magician as he closed the hole.</p>
<p>“Well, this sucks,” Fernandi whined.</p>
<p>“Agreed,” commented Ryan.</p>
<p>As they both turned around, their jaws dropped and Fernandi guessed, “Toto, I don’t think we’re in Kansas anymore.”</p>
<p>“But we were in California, and my name is Ryan” Ryan answered.</p>
<p>“Well, we ain’t there either, Ryan,” Fernandi replied, “We must be in the future.” They were both standing on a skyscraper and below them were millions of hovercrafts, huge buildings, and a big, bright, sign saying “Ozland”.  As they explored their surroundings, a little hyper boy on turbo wheelchair zipped in front of them. He was also holding a delicious chocolate donut.</p>
<p>“Stop, no access to Ozland without ID and donuts,” the guy announced.</p>
<p>“Um, we have French fries and root beer,” Fernandi offered with a grin.</p>
<p>“That will work,” the guy shrugged as he ate it up, “Oh, my name is David.”</p>
<p>As they greeted each other, Fernandi asked, “Where are we and do you know how to get back to my dimension?”</p>
<p>After they explained their problems (they were actually on a different planet), David said, “The only way to bring you home is to meet the mighty Wizard of Oz.”</p>
<p>“Who’s that?” Ryan asked.</p>
<p>“The most powerful wizard of all time!” David said with enthusiasm as he led them to a hovercraft taxi. Before they could enter, a multitude of deadly lasers were pointed at them from a bunch of cyborgs.</p>
<p>“Stop you are under arrest in the name of the Evil Enchantress of the East,” said one cyborg in a monotonous voice.</p>
<p>“Run?” Fernandi offered. All of them agreed as they separated into the midst of the buzzing city trailed by deadly cyborgs. But the cyborgs outnumbered the three friends 50 to one and they were soon cornered.</p>
<p>“Um, I out of food and alcohol to throw at them, so do you a plan?” Fernandi asked.</p>
<p>“I got nothing,” David said calmly finishing his root beer. Ryan hid inside his shell.  Then the cyborgs fired frying lasers at the hopeless humans. Miraculously, they all missed. The cyborgs then took careful aim and reloaded. They fired again at the helpless humans. This time they were stopped by a flaming star that vaporized all the cyborgs. This star turned out to be a human-like alien female.</p>
<p>“Hi, my name FireStar, but people call me Trish. If you need me, just call.” the alien said throwing them a walky-talky with a T on it. Fernandi, Ryan, and David stood there stunned. After they got out their shock, they went into a club for a victory party. They all got drunk off alien wine and all fainted.</p>
