		<p>The team of friends woke up in a trash bin not remembering much on what happened last night. They had a vague memory of being chased by cyborgs and burning the bar to the ground. However, besides the usual headache and feeling like garbage (literally), everyone was fine. They washed up in a public bathroom and continued on their journey. Now having two superheroes on their side, what could go wrong?</p>
<p>Meanwhile... the Evil Enchantress of the East was brushing her hair vigorously as she insulted Alejandri Cobra-Chicken who was cringing in fear on his knees begging for forgiveness. The Evil Enchantress was outraged for letting the group escape.</p>
<p>Then with a creepy smile she came closer to Alejandri (who almost wet his pants) and whispered, “Do you know what will happen to you if you fail one more time, my dear?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, so sorry!” Alejandri sobbed.</p>
<p>“You better be. Since I’m such a nice witch, I’ll give you one more day to exterminate those pests. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“Yes, your majesty,” Alejandri whimpered</p>
<p>“If you fail again,” Ariana (the witch’s true name) whispered as she stroked Alejandri’s scaly back, “you’ll be my next purse.” At this point, Alejandri had done more then wet his pants as he dashed from the room, terrified.</p>
<p>With a satisfied smile, Ariana commanded, “Now where’s my nail polish?”</p>
<p>Meanwhile... the group of adventurers halted as they saw what laid in front of them. It was the most horrid and dreadful forest they had ever seen. Even looking at it from a distance sent shivers down the courageous Robin. Every part of each group’s member told them to turn back and to hide under their covers. Everyone except Fernandi that is.</p>
<p>The green Fernandi was overly confident (side effects of alien wine) and ecstatically stated, “Come on you scaredy cats! What’s the worst that could happen?”</p>
<p>“Getting your head ripped off,” muttered Bill whose head was now super-glued on. The group slowly trudged into the creepy forest. Once they entered the forest, it felt like a door slamming shut in a haunted house. The sun disappeared and weird noises filled the air. Fernandi’s zeal and confidence soon waned away as they crept closer into the midst of the forest. Every step they got closer in the forest, it got colder and creepier. Unknown creatures crawled on the floor. Creepy noises continued to echo. The sun was no more. The wind was howling. And it felt like someone was watching them. Suddenly, a shriek erupted from the shadows. Like a stick of dynamite, the friends exploded into different directions running for their life from an inexplicable monster. Trish flew as fast as she could randomly shooting starbolts behind her as she blasted through the forest. Izrael sprinted while throwing bombs and boomerangs around him, shredding the ugly trees down. Bill swung from tree to tree crazily as he threw banana bombs at moving shadows. David pressed his turbo button as he zoomed through the forest dodging any bumps and roadblocks along the way.  Ryan crawled as fast as he could, but soon got tired so he just did an imitation of a rock. Fernandi, unfortunately, just rammed into a tree and fell into a pool filled with an unknown stinky substance...  At least he was unconscious.</p>
<p>Meanwhile... Alejandri called his army of killer penguins, Twinkies, and gorillas to assemble. The army was so big; you could even smell the sweet, furry, and fishy smell from miles away. In addition to the savage birds, evil pastries, and vicious primates, Alejandri held a secret weapon so horrifying; it could make even a full grown Hydra to faint. Alejandri cackled in joy as he snacked on some mayonnaise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile... the friends weren’t as lucky. They were split up in a scary forest and had an army after them.</p>
<p>The first victim was Trish. She was being chased by a charging group of pastries. She maniacally fired starbolts at the Twinkies until they were nothing but crumbs. Unfortunately, they kept piling toward her. She was soon overwhelmed as the Twinkies suffocated her. Even with the strength of a superhero, Firestar could not escape from the over-sized snacks.</p>
<p>She yelled out a strangled scream, “Help...”</p>
<p>The next one down was Robin. He got the killer penguins. Robin started doing crazy kung fu which smashed the front line of penguins. However, Robin tripped on a tree root and fell face down onto the ground. The penguins jumped on him before he could even wipe the dirt from his face. They started to chew and poke the terrified Robin immediately. Robin then calmed himself down and threw a grenade to the floor and leaped away as it exploded. Robin smiled as when he saw that the penguins were gone.</p>
<p>“Booyah!” Robin cheered. However, his celebration was short lived when he saw black and white birds flying right at him. “Wait, penguins can’t fl—” Robin got tackled by a diving penguin before he could finish. The rest of the penguins were on him like flies on cow poo. Robin had no chance of escaping.</p>
<p>David came next. He was speeding through the forest while teasing and insulting Alejandri as it slithered after him. Then he ran out of gas. David cussed and started to wheel away manually. Alejandri went in front of him quickly and broke the wheelchair in half with his tail.</p>
<p>Alejandri hissed at David evilly. “You will make a great appetizer.”</p>
<p>David gulped and said, “I’m more of a desert type of guy.”</p>
<p>“Whatever,” Alejandri said and leaped. David screamed.</p>
<p>Bill had the luck of getting gorillas chasing after him. Once he was cornered, Bill tried to throw banana bombs, but that just made them angrier.</p>
<p>When he was out of bombs, Bill tried to compromise, “You can’t hurt me! I’m like your cousin! Say what, I will give you some banana ice cream if you let me go! That witch never gives you good food does she?” The gorillas pondered about the offer. Bad treatment with no good food and a happy witch or good food and an angry witch. The gorillas shuddered and decided that at least they could still eat when the witch was happy. They charged at the hopeless tin monkey.</p>
<p>“Don’t pull of my head!” Bill wailed.</p>
<p>Fernandi, however, was still knocked out in a pit smelling like poo. Unfortunately, he won’t be at peace for long. The secret weapon was after him...</p>
<p><em>Will the friends survive? What will happen to Fernandi? What is the secret weapon? Where’s Ryan? Find out in the next chapter!</em></p>
<p><em>P.S. They do faint by the way!</em></p>
