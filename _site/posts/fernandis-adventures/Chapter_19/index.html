		<p>Ryan the rabbit and Fernandi the fish woke up to find themselves surrounded by a dark and ominous cloud surrounding them. The two animals shuttered from the spookiness of the scene and because they were twitching from side effects of lightning.</p>
<p>Ryan said as he twitched his nose, “Um... we can’t be dreaming the same dream can we?”</p>
<p>Fernandi splashed around a bit in his fishbowl in response. Ryan decided that Fernandi wanted some carrots and dropped some in Fernandi’s fishbowl. Fernandi started to chew the carrots when suddenly a big lightning struck the ground blowing back the friends to their butts (or scaly back). Ryan nervously stared at the figure in complete petrification. Fernandi flopped on the floor.</p>
<p>The blurry figure behind the swirling black mist boomed, “We meet again,” and started coughing uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Ryan asked, “Um, are you ok? Do you want some cough drops?”</p>
<p>The dark figure squeaked as he coughed, “That would be nice,” as he gulped down carrot flavored cough drops. After an awkward pause, the person stepped forward. It was Roberto the Wizard of Oz. Ryan the rabbit’s jaw dropped. Fernandi the fish laid still either from surprise or from lack of oxygen. Roberto snapped his fingers and Ryan was a regular talking turtle and Fernandi was a regular (kind of) human again. Fernandi immediately took a big breath and gurgled out water as he squirmed on the floor.</p>
<p>Once he finished recovering, Fernandi screamed, “Why did you zap us?! Where were you when we almost died from the killer penguins and like 15 other close-to-death situations?! And um... are you okay?” Roberto was close to tears and looked like someone who just got beat up, lost his money, house, and everything he owned, which was what actually happened. He was wearing rags, had broken glasses, had a nasty black eye, was on crutches, wearing an arm cast, and blood stains everywhere.</p>
<p>Roberto solemnly answered, “First, I had to zap you because I could only communicate to you when you were unconscious. Second, how am I suppose to save you when I can’t even defend myself. Third, no I am not okay. Lastly, I came here to deliver you a grave message. The Dark Magician is going full force. He isn’t going to play any games anymore. He wants you out of the picture now. And he just took out one of your allies... I have delayed the Dark Magician as long as I could, but I can no longer help you. I am currently trapped in an inescapable prison cell with no powers. What you see now is just everything I could muster to warn you,” Roberto suddenly started coughing again and started to go fuzzy like a TV image, “My power is fading. Fernandi, you need to get out of here. Forget the quest; the princess is no longer in danger. Just get out of here and never come back. If you don’t, you will face horrible consequences. And if you are idiotic enough to ignore my warnings, have this amulet to protect from the Dark Magician’s magic. That is it. Good-bye.” With that speech, Roberto the Wizard of Oz faded away, and Fernandi and Ryan woke up. They looked at each other with serious faces.</p>
<p>Ryan then prompted, “So we follow Roberto’s instructions and get the heck out of here right?”’</p>
<p>“No,” Fernandi commanded bravely, “Roberto sacrificed himself for us and we are not backing down from this challenge.”</p>
<p>“I thought so,” Ryan sighed. Then the duo charged down the gates to find three guinea pigs on the floor eating celery.</p>
<p>“Um... have you guinea pigs seen a tin monkey, a guy on a wheelchair, an alien girl, and a guy wearing tights,” Fernandi asked. The guinea pigs squeaked excitedly.</p>
<p>Ryan translated, “Um, these guinea pigs are Bill, David, and Robin. They said that they were transformed to guinea pigs by the Evil Enchantress. But when they defeated the guards, everyone disappeared including the witch.”</p>
<p>Fernandi said, “Dang it! I mean... why did everyone disappear? And where’s Firestar?” The three guinea pigs looked at their tiny toes guiltily. “Where is she? Is she trapped? Let’s go find her?” Fernandi cried. The guinea pigs started to cry (which looks kind of cute actually).</p>
<p>Ryan gasped, “I think they’re saying that she’s ... dead.”</p>
<p>Fernandi screamed, “What???????!!!!!!!!!!! No, that’s a mistake! How can she be dead?!”</p>
<p>Ryan said, “Let’s turn them back to regular first then we can talk about this.”</p>
<p>“Well, well, well, look who's here.” boomed a loud voice. Fernandi and Ryan and the guinea pigs whipped around and saw the evilest thing that they have ever experienced. It was the Dark Magician. Even his own presence radiated evil and coldness throughout the room. The friends couldn’t respond due to their awe and terror. “I believe you didn’t follow your friends advice,” the man in the black coat hissed, “You will regret that. I had enough of you imbeciles. You can join your friend, Trish into the underworld. Alakazam!” A dark huge ray shot from the magician’s hand at the group of petrified friends. They all blacked out... forever.</p>
