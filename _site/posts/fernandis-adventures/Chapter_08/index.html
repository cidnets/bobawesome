		<p>As a tin monkey, a turtle, an alien person, and an alcoholic woke up looking at the beautiful purple sky of Ozland, they all vomited in unison. Then they continued their destination to Diamond Town. The group walked down the path merrily (sort of) until they were stopped by a huge and vicious three-headed dragon that made Godzilla look like a toy. They froze in terror. Before the monster could even roar, it found itself tied up and slammed to the ground by unknown figure. The group of friends stood in awe as they saw the person take down the furious and stunned dragon. Although the three-headed dragon fought back ferociously as it fired out hot blue flames from its jaws and slashed its sharp claws with stealth and power, the dragon ended up knocked out and without teeth.</p>
<p>“Wow! You just defeated the monster Hydra, single handedly! Who are you?” David asked.</p>
<p>“People call me Robin, but my real name is Izrael. Call me if you need help,” Robin answered as he threw a familiar looking walkie-talkie.</p>
<p>“Thanks Robin!” all of them yelled as he drove off.</p>
<p>“Well this was a short and fast story,” Fernandi commented, “we didn’t even have to fight or chomp off monsters’ heads or anything!” Unfortunately, to their (bad) luck, the Hydra woke up and it wasn’t happy. The friends looked at each other and ran for their lives. In panic, Fernandi threw the walkie-talkie into the dragon’s mouth. As they dashed to the end of the hill, Bill tripped on a rock a rolled into one of the dragons mouth. Hydra gulped in joy. Everyone stood in shock. Then the three heads of the dragons turned red and started to retch maniacally. Finally with a crazy gag, the tin monkey flew out. The three-headed dragon disintegrated slowly as it limped away.</p>
<p>“Yeah! Run away you pussy!” Bill yelled triumphantly.</p>
<p>“What did you do? And what did it look like in a dragon’s intestines?” Fernandi asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, I just fed it some alcohol oil and it looked like dragon guts.” Bill replied. Finally, they all celebrated with some alcohol wine and fainted in unison</p>
