		<p>Meanwhile... while Fernandi and Ryan the turtle was nearing their death, the rest of the gang was crunched up in a tiny cell. They were all uncomfortably cramped up and had tight, unbreakable shackles on their hands and legs. Trish woke up and tried to stand up, but failed and accidentally punched the sore Robin in the nose. Robin (now with a bloody nose) groaned as he tried to turn around, but just slipped and karate kicked Bill the crumpled tin monkey across the room. Bill smacked into the David the chairless giving him a bigger headache. The pathetic bunch sat motionless on the floor trying not to kill each other unintentionally. Then the magic-enforced, steel door swung open. In front of them, there stood a gorgeous lady, who stared evilly at her prisoners. The males of the group stood with their mouths open, mesmerized, and forgot all about their pains and troubles.</p>
<p>“Well, boys, do you want to stay in this nasty cell or go experiment with some of my torture machines?” the witch said persuasively in charm speak (enchanted voice) as she unbuckled the male prisoners.</p>
<p>“Yeah, cool, torture. Let’s go.” the boys said as they stood up and followed the evil enchantress.</p>
<p>“Wait! What are you guys doing? She’s evil whoever she is!” Trish yelled at the expressionless boys. The guys looked at each other confused as they scratched their heads.</p>
<p>“Don’t be jealous,” the witch snarled, “My name is Ariana and you’ll get the special treatment. Now come on guys.”</p>
<p>The brainwashed boys followed. In desperation, Trish tried to fire a starbolt at Ariana, but ended up shocking herself.</p>
<p>“Nice try dear!” the Evil Enchantress of the East cackled as she slammed the door shut. Trish fell to the ground desolate that she failed to save her friends.</p>
<p>Meanwhile... Fernandi and Ryan laid faint on the ground. The horrid monster loomed over the couple ready to devour them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile...Fernandi’s mind went from pitch black to blaring white.</p>
<p>“Aaaaah!” Fernandi screamed, “I thought I fainted! Oh no! Am I dead?”</p>
<p>“No, but you will be if you don’t wake up now!” barked Roberto the Wizard. Roberto was wearing a ridiculous outfit: a banana peel skirt, an orange peel dress, a pair of avocado shoes, a noodle wig, a carrot nose, a macaroni necklace, and other food products as clothes.</p>
<p>“What are you wearing?” Fernandi giggled as he unsuccessfully tried to suppress his laughter.</p>
<p>“I don’t know man,” Roberto sighed, “your dream altered my awesome Sonic clothes. I guess you’re hungry. Gotta go now! Monsters everywhere!” With  that Roberto disappeared. Fernandi  immediately woke up to find himself  staring at a 10-foot jaw filled with sharp teeth. Instead of screaming his head off, Fernandi let loose an earsplitting fart. The thunderous (and smelly) fart echoed off through the woods. Ryan then unfroze and started to laugh maniacally.</p>
<p>“Nice one dude!” Ryan chuckled as he struggled to breathe. Soon the two friends started rolling around the ground laughing, tears (of joy) rolling down their cheeks.</p>
<p>“Silence!” Alojandra roared looking far from amused, “You should be scared of me!”</p>
<p>With a brave face, Fernandi stood up and announced, “You may be ugly, but you don’t scare me. You hurt my friends and you are going down!” Then with pure determination (and foolishness), Fernandi charged at the 20-ton monster with Ryan tucked in his armpit. Unfortunately, Fernandi slipped on the monster’s slobber and Ryan flew right into the Alojandra’s wide open mouth.</p>
<p>“Ryan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!” Fernandi screamed.</p>
<p>“One more to go,”  the monster growled. Then she stormed right at Fernandi. A normal person at normal circumstances would have died on the spot if they spotted Alojondra charging at them, but Fernandi was no ordinary person and this was no ordinary circumstance. Fernandi did the obvious thing and charged at the rampaging monster. Blind with rage, Fernandi went into crazy mode. He punched, kicked, tackled, kneed, bit, scratched, slapped, and head-butted at the huge monster. Fernandi didn’t make a scratch. With a flick of a tail Fernandi slammed into a tree with incredible force that shattered his bones.</p>
<p>“Ow,” Fernandi gasped. Then the monster opened her mouth ready to swallow the injured Fernandi. Fernandi, ignoring the pain, gripped his mega extra-strength killer whisky and lobbed it into Alojondra’s mouth.</p>
<p>“Thanks for the drink,” Alojondra cackled, unaffected by the alcohol. Fernandi laid their stunned for two reasons. One: Nobody could survive drinking that. Two: This was the end. Roberto was busy, his friends were imprisoned, Ryan got eaten, and he was helpless in front of a horrible monster. Nobody could save him. Fernandi closed his eyes ready to be ripped apart.</p>
<p>Suddenly, out of nowhere, Alojondra started to glow gold. Alojondra looked at herself not knowing what was happening. Then, the barfing started. Seeing a monster like Alojondra vomit was enough to terrify anybody, but to be smothered in it was a different story. By the time the retching ended, Fernandi was floating in monster throw-up. Fernandi suddenly wished he never accepted this quest.</p>
<p>“You will pay for that,” Alojandra rasped. But before she could even nibble Fernandi, a gold turtle shot out of her mouth.</p>
<p>“You aren’t paying anything,” Ryan said. With that, the golden turtle charged at the empty-stomached monster. Alojandra tried to bite Ryan, but he was too fast. After a few minutes of beating up a monster, Ryan glowed to a brighter shade of gold. When it was unbearingly bright, Ryan exploded instantly blasting the enormous monster into outer space.</p>
<p>“Wow,” Fernandi breathed, “When did you get superpowers?”</p>
<p>“I think it was because the whisky and monster guts mixed together that gave me super powers. I guess it’s kind of like radioactive waste,” Ryan answered. “It’s temporary though,” Ryan added as his gold color faded away.</p>
<p>“Ok, let’s talk about your turtle powers later. Can you get me out of this vomit?” Fernandi begged.</p>
<p>“Sure.” Ryan said as he dragged Fernandi through the disgusting monster bile. After cracking all of Fernandi’s bones back together, they celebrated their victory by drinking lots of (regular) whisky. They both fainted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile...Trish stood inches away from a flaming pit of lava. Blister and heat seared her body like a cooked pig. The chain holding her in the air lowered as she screamed.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this fun, boys!” Ariana laughed. The enchanted men nodded enthusiastically as they snacked on popcorn.</p>
<p>“Help me,” Trish cried desperately. The males kept eating buttered popcorn.</p>
<p>“Ok, enough of this. Drop her!” Ariana ordered.</p>
<p><em>Will Trish survive? Will the boys snap out of their enchantment? What will Fernandi and Ryan do next? Find out in the  next chapter!</em></p>
