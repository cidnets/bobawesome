		<p>Roberto was a normal old guy. He enjoyed whittling wood into animals (especially hedgehogs), playing Bingo with his friends, and sleeping under the stars. He was also a wizard and savior of Ozland, a faraway chaotic and magical planet that contains creatures ranging from three-headed dragons to cannibalistic penguins. Years ago, Ozland, which faced the brink of world domination by an evil, cruel wizard, aptly named Dark Magician, was rescued by Roberto as well as Fernandi (a random hobo that fell into Ozland) and his crew. Using their combined powers, luck, and indigestion, Roberto and Fernandi defeated the almighty Dark Magician.</p>
<p>Despite the tons of monsters and minions that the Dark Magician commanded, his forces were destroyed at the final battle and he disappeared, never to be seen again, assumed to be dead from the mighty explosion. Once the defeat of Dark Magician and his army was ensured, Roberto, who was now handicapped from the war, retired from his position of Minister of Magicry and Defense while Fernandi was returned home to Earth. Unfortunately, after Fernandi was sent home through a portal that Roberto summoned, the portal system, an instantaneous transportation system, mysteriously failed to work ever again. No one was able to come back and forth between Earth and Ozland.</p>
<p>Sipping his tea, Roberto reminisced back to the days when his life was superspeed and everything was crazy. Letting his thoughts drift off, Roberto wondered how Fernandi was doing. It was months after the epic final battle, and order and peace was restored in Ozland. However, Roberto did not get a chance to check on Fernandi since. Using his scrying bowl, Roberto looked into the shimmering water. In the water, Roberto saw Fernandi scrunched up under a tree, in what seemed to be a dense forest, eating some cereal bars. Smiling to himself, Roberto was about to toss the water down the drain when from the corner of his eye, he saw a pair of abnormally large, pale, yellow snake eyes glow faintly behind Fernandi. Without hesitation, Roberto shielded Fernandi from sight and called birds of prey to the area.</p>
<p>Sweat dripping down his forehead and his knees shaking from shock, Roberto pulled a government issued emergency walkie-talkie from his robe, and whispered into it, “He’s back. The Dark Magican is alive and on Earth. We must regroup and alert all of our Earth agents promptly to control the damage. Schedule an emergency meeting immediately. Roberto out.”</p>
<p>Sitting down and massaging his temples, Robert vowed, “I will protect you with my last breath, Fernandi. I won’t let you die after all you’ve done.”</p>
