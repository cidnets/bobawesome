Fernandi woke up with a shock. Ryan and Fernandi were pure green (Ryan looked the same though). 

“Must be side effects of the alien wine,” David commented, who was perfectly fine, “it’ll probably go away.”

After a grouchy breakfast of granola bars and milk (no more beer), Fernandi asked, “So where do we go now?”

“To Diamond Town of course,” David said, “that’s where the Wizard of Oz is.” Once everyone was ready, they headed to their destination on a Rent-a-Hovercraft. Before they could get far, they noticed something on the road. It was a rusty little monkey standing on the road. They cautiously walked up to the tin monkey. With a shriek, the monkey turned around wildly throwing banana peel bombs at the friends. They scrambled in cover. Unfortunately, one hit Fernandi in the face causing him to turn to a greenish yellow color. As the monkey continued to bombard the friends with banana bombs, Fernandi tried to run away, but slipped on banana peel instead. 

Frantically, David said, “We come in peace and we have donuts.” Ryan and Fernandi nodded eagerly trying to stop the monkey from throwing bananas. The tin monkey agreed as he chomped down banana filled donuts. 

“So, what’s your name?” asked Fernandi.

“Bill, and why are you green?” the tin monkey answered.

“Alien wine,” Fernandi replied, “Why did you attack us?”

“Because I thought you were those evil cyborgs coming to get me. Cyborgs don’t like hobo tin monkeys.” Bill said. 

After Bill finished his fill of donuts (all of them), he said “Where are you guys going anyway?” When they explained to Bill that they were going to Diamond Town, Bill agreed to follow them on their journey. Before they could even enter the hovercraft, it was shot down and vaporized. When they looked up, they saw big monsters shaped like pastries charging at them. 

David and Bill panicked at the sight and yelled, “Twinkies!!! Run for your life!” Fernandi and Ryan snickered at the name. They stopped their giggling when one Twinkie landed in front of them smashing a group of trees and roared. Smelling like various sweets, they scrambled. Bill threw banana peel bombs, but that just made them angrier. The Twinkies pulled out candy spears and charged at the frantic friends. 

“You should call that alien girl now!” David yelled. Fernandi fumbled out the walky-talky, but he accidentally dropped it down the cliff. 

“We’re doomed,” wailed Bill, “I don’t want to be eaten alive!”

“That’s it!” Fernandi yelped, “We have to eat them!” With that statement, two humans, a turtle, and a tin monkey leaped onto the Twinkies ferociously gorging down the yummy and surprised Twinkies. Although the Twinkies fought back furiously, they couldn’t stop the savage friends who were chomping them down like cookies (literally). After 10 minutes of nonstop munching and crunching, there stood nothing in their paths except green, pale, and stuffed friends. They all washed it down with some leftover wine and all fainted.
