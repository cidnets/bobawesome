When the group of friends woke up, they found themselves with an excruciating and pain-splitting migraine and a burning stomach from the alcohol oil. However, Bill the tin monkey, was perfectly fine except for a few rusts on his boots. Fernandi stood up slowly and wearily, but fell back abruptly in pain and started to barf. The others attempted to stand without success (except for Bill, who was cheerfully eating a banana while swinging from branch to branch). After the pleasant experience, they all continued on to their destination. Once they already walked about 10 miles, they stopped for lunch. When they finished their individual lunches (Fernandi: peanut butter granola bars, 10 chicken McNuggets, and a swig of alcohol oil/milk; Bill: a bunch of bananas and banana flavored tofu, and a banana smoothie; David: a box with a variety of chocolate donuts; Ryan: potato salad sprinkled with alien mushrooms and a drink of Coke). 

Fernandi commented, “Hey, this has been a quiet day! No monsters!” At that instant, a throng of huge, angry, vicious, gorillas with sharp horns in armor charged out of the bush and grabbed all of the friends in an inescapable headlock. 

“You just had to say that!” David squeaked. That a shimmer came through the air and an image of the Dark Magician and behind him was the beautiful, gorgeous, and dazzling princess Suzzana. She was tied to her chair and had duct-taped over her mouth.
 
The Dark Magician glared over them and cackled, “Do you think you could escape to Ozland without me killing you? Well, you thought wrong! When I order these trained killing machines to murder you, you better not resist or else,” the Dark Magician pulled a lever with a manic laugh, “she will drop in this lava pit and die and your quest will fail! Even if you escape, the Evil Enchantress of the East will destroy and make you to suffer!” After finishing his laughter, he briskly said, “Ok, kill them now.” and the vision disappeared. With fury and rage, Fernandi roared like a ten-ton Hydra and unleashed his inner power and wrath. The gorilla that was holding Fernandi down met the unfortunate event of being flipped over and smashed against the wall and kneed in the groin. One gorilla laid unconscious. Before the other gorillas could react, Fernandi turned around enraged and attacked the rest of them like a rabid Minotaur. The stunned gorillas stepped back in confusion (they were usually the ones inflicting the terror and pain) while they got pummeled and assaulted continuously. In less than 2 minutes, the once vicious gorillas all laid dazed and stationary on the ground while the crazed Fernandi stood. After a few minutes of angrily punching the wall and cursing, Fernandi sat down and started to cry. Ryan, David, and Bill tried to comfort him, but it was no use. The princess Suzanna was dead and the chance of getting out of Ozland without being killed by the Evil Enchantress or her minions were as small as making a Cyclops go vegan. The glum friends ended the day with some rubbing alcohol* and all fainted.
