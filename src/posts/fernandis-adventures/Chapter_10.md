Fernandi woke up feeling great, despite the horrible event yesterday. He didn’t even feel the hangover from drinking tons of alcohol the night before. “This must be a dream,” Fernandi said amazed.

“That’s because it is, you doofus!” somebody yelled. 

Fernandi turned around shocked and asked, “Umm... do I know you and how come you’re in my dream if this is a dream?” 

“I’m the Wizard of Oz!” proclaimed the guy with shaggy hair and rectangular glasses, “but you can call me Roberto! I am here in your dream to tell you important news. The princess is still alive and there is still hope. If you make it to Diamond Town alive, I’ll promise you to transport you home safely.”

Fernandi gasped as he stuttered, “Well, why don’t you just poof us there? How do you know you’re not just the Dark Magician in disguise?”

Roberto laughed, “First, I could ‘poof’ you anywhere, but what’s the fun in that? Secondly, I’m not the Dark Magician because the Dark Magician wouldn’t have...” and he ripped off his cloak, revealing his amazing Sonic the Hedgehog T-shirt. “Tah-tah for now, and by the way, you should drink this potion in the morning,” as Roberto faded away.

“Wait! No come back! What potion? I have more questions!” Fernandi yelled. Then, the most horrendous part came. Fernandi woke up. Instead of feeling amazingly strong or inspired as he should be. Fernandi woke up with the worst (this means a lot since its Fernandi) hangover of his life. Symptoms include uncontrollable vomiting, nausea, irritable stomach pains, excruciating migraines, extreme muscle cramps and spasms, dehydration, blurry vision, abnormal heart rate, and much more other horrifying pains tortured Fernandi. The others woke up with similar effects, but not as severely as Fernandi. Then Fernandi looked down and saw a green potion. He drank it up with no hesitation leaving some for the others. The pain ceased immediately and all of them fell into an exhausted and dreamless sleep. Fighting monsters weren’t as rigorous work as battling the nasty effects of alcohol. 

Meanwhile, in the deep forest of Ozland, lived a cruel and mean witch. Her name was the Evil Enchantress of the East, and she didn’t like the idea of Fernandi still alive. She cackled, “I will find a way to destroy them if it’s the last thing I do! Send out the penguins!”
