Fernandi woke up to find himself on a flying saucer strapped to a bed with a shining light blazing right at him. Fernandi’s first assumption was that he was kidnapped by aliens. Then he remembered that he was saved by androids and he was probably going to be dissected and be subjected to horrible torture. Fernandi cried both from fear and homesickness. He wanted nothing more than just to be taken back to Earth and continue eating McNuggets and chugging down Bud Lights on the streets.

“Well look at the hero, crying like a baby,” Ulizes  walked in holding a cane. 

“Who are you?” sniffled Fernandi, “and where are the rest of the guys?” 

Ulizes looked at Fernandi gravely and stated, “I am Ulizes, the technology wizard. Your friends are fine except for the turtle, but I can sense that he is still alive. However, the big problem is your weakness. You look pathetic.” 

Fernandi, who was no longer crying, stared murderously at Ulizes and screamed in rage, “You don’t know what I’ve been through! I’ve defeated monsters as horrible as Medusa and survived the Dark Magician’s wrath!”

“Oh really!” Ulizes chuckled, “Those monsters were merely toys and distractions. If the Dark Magician was trying, you wouldn’t even be here. Besides, the only reason you’re alive is because of your incredible luck and friends. You don’t deserve to be a hero. You’re just a worthless hobo on a streets.”

“Take that back!” Fernandi yelled as he pulled on his restraints.

Ulizes smirked, “Don’t worry, though. I am going to help you. I will turn you into warriors and show you what it is to be a true hero. Life won’t be easy, but after my training session you will become a god.”

“Why are you helping me?” Fernandi questioned suspiciously.

“Because you’re the world’s last hope,” Ulizes said to Fernandi solemnly, “now, follow me to meet your friends and start your training. We don’t have much time.” Fernandi’s restraints was unclipped and he quickly followed Ulizes to a huge room that looked like the interior of a starship.

“By the way, you’re standing on my starcraft that I built all by myself,” Ulizes said proudly. Fernandi looked around and was amazed by the advanced technology. Soon, Fernandi was reunited by his group.

“What’s up!” Bill the tin monkey cried, “This plane doesn’t even have bananas! It’s horrible!”

“We need to save Ryan the turtle!” Robin cried to Ulizes. David was feasting on different kind of donuts while Fernandi was checking the fridge for some beer. 

“Ryan will be fine,” Ulizes said, “Our main priority is to train you guys to at least a fighting chance to defeat the Dark Magician. I will turn you from a bunch of hooligans to a group of fierce soldiers.”

Robin (Izrael) marched up to Ulizes and said to his face, “I am a superhero. I was trained by the Batman himself. I don’t need an old man’s help” Ulizes gave him a smug smile and whipped out his cane,  blasting Robin across the room. Robin laid dazed on the floor. Fernandi and the guys stared at Ulizes in shock.

“Rule number one: Don’t piss me off,” Ulizes growled, “Now let the training begin!..” With that, Ulizes pressed a button and a dozen of androids bursted through the room.

“Wait timeout!” Fernandi cried, “I wasn’t told of this!” Ulizes laughed creepily and sat down on his chair while he munched on buttered popcorn. 

“You have 10 seconds before I unleash these androids on you,” Ulizes said as he munched on his popcorn. Fernandi and his posse ran for their lives.

Meanwhile... Trish could no longer hold her breath. After 2 weeks of trying to live in boiling lava, Trish could not take much longer. Desperately, she moved out her hibernation state and pushed towards the surface. As a result of leaving her protective bubble she was susceptible to the unbearable pain of hot lava. However, Firestar (Trish), pushed herself to escape. It was hopeless. Inches away from the surface, Firestar’s lungs collapsed causing her to slip away. Firestar was going to die. Suddenly, out of nowhere a hand plunged through the lava and yanked Trish out the lava. Trish stared at the figure who saved her life.

“Hi, my name is Darylee,”a dark warrior dressed in armor, “let’s get out of here” Trish nodded and fainted. Darylee carried the unconscious Trish up the stairs. 

“Where do you think you’re going?” Alejandri the Cobra-Chicken hissed, “Kill them all!” Killer gorillas and penguins lurched forward the couple. 

Meanwhile... Roberto and the Dark Wizard were both trapped in a black hole. 

The Dark Magician cackled, “Thank you for bringing me with you to the black hole Roberto! Now I am fully healed and can destroy you once and for all!” 

Roberto struggled to stand and defiantly stated, “We’ll see about that!” Roberto zapped the Dark Magician with a lightning spell, which he deflected easily.

“Hmmm, you have the spirit, Roberto. Most wizards would not even be able to live in this dark black hole, much less produce a spell. I will find you very useful as a servant” the Dark Magician said evilly.

“I rather eat poisonous slugs then to serve you! You’re a disgusting evil warlock!” Roberto cried.

“It wasn’t a request,” the Dark Magician stated. He placed his hand on Roberto’s head and dark magic spurted out! “You are my slave!” the Dark Magician yelled.

“Never! No! NO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!” Roberto screamed as he tried to fight the magic. It was all in vain: “I am your slave. Your wish is my command,” Roberto said as he slumped into a trance. 

“Wonderful! Wonderful!”the Dark Magician boomed.

Meanwhile... in a land far away, Brondan, also known as Rumble or Brandyxkillr, woke up from his sleep. Rumble was no ordinary person. He was a legendary god. More specifically, he was the ninja god of good. Before retiring to live with his beautiful mistress, Sydnee, in the peaceful islands of Asgard (which was filled with peaches), he fought evil and was a good at it as well. He slayed countless monsters, overthrown five tyrants, pushed the devil off a cliff, and even... defeated the Dark Magician. Now, Brondan, 10 years later, sensed that the world needed him. The side of evil and good was tilting and he needed to balance it.. Brondan put on his Rumble suit and left a note to Sydnee. It stated “I’m sorry Sydnee. The world needs me. Love Brondan” 

Just as he was about to step out the window, Sydnee bursted through the door and hissed, “What do you think you’re doing? Why did you put your ninja suit on? You better not be doing what I think you’re doing!”  Brondan sweated as he fumbled for an answer.

“I’m sorry,” Brondon said and flicked Sydnee with amnesia dust. However, Sydnee was no nincompoop. She was the daughter of the a nature god and a death god giving her great power and intelligence. While Brondan had the powers of stealth, invisiblity, and strength, Sydnee held the power of bending reality, molding earth, seduction, and a really scary stare when she got mad.Although Brondan was a do-gooder, Sydnee, ironically, was not. In fact, she was the main supporter of the Dark Magician back in the day. Currently, Sydnee fumed at Brondan as she blew the dust back at Brondan’s face. Luckily, Brondan was wearing a mask.

“How dare you try that dirty trick on me?” Sydnee screamed, “You’re going to leave me to fight the Dark Magician! You promised to me that your fighting days was over!”

Brondan pleaded, “Don’t you see that the world is going to end up being taken over by a psychotic wizard! I need to stop it!”

“It’s none of our business and he’s not psychotic!” Sydney yelled.

“Now you’re defending him!” Brondan cried in a disgusted and hurt voice.

“All I want is for you to be safe,” Sydnee said with a smile.

“Oh, well I guess... HEY! You were putting me in a trance!” Brandon replied aghast.

“I had no choice, and besides, you were the one who tried to knock me out first!” Sydnee shot back, “You’re not going anywhere! If you leave this house, then don’t plan me on helping you! Now choose! The world’s safety or me.”
 
Brondan grabbed his sword and said, “I was born to protect the world.” Brondan disappeared in a puff of smoke!

“NO!” Sydnee cried. In frustration, she pulled out her phone book and called her allies.  

“I need you to stop Brandyxkillr at all cost, but bring him in alive,” Sydnee said.

“As you  wish,” the other end of the line stated.

Brondan, who was dashing across the land of Ozland, was furious. He hated getting in fights with Sydnee, especially ones about good and evil. However, he knew that he had chose the right path to save the world. Suddenly, an explosion popped right in front of Brondan. In front of Brandyxkillr’s path was Tuna the Great.

“Greetings, my friend, have you come here to join me to defeat the evil Dark Magician,” Brondan stated.

“No, quite the contrary. I have come Rumble, to take you down,” Tuna said with a smile.

“Who sent you?” Brandyxkillr barked as he pulled out his sword. 

“That is not your concern,” Tuna smiled. Brandyxkillr roared and unleashed a swirl of electro-harpoons right at Tuna’s face.  Tuna dodged out of the way, but Brondan pressured with his sword as he hammered Tuna repeatedly. 

“My friend, you have gotten out of shape. You’ve grown soft!” Tuna laughed as he punched Brondan and threw him on the ground. “I could defeat you without even using my weapons! What has come of you Rumble? You used to be one of the mightiest gods! None the matter, this just makes my job easier!”

Brandyxkillr breathed heavily, for he was outmatched and beaten. 

“I am sorry friend. Now, you shall die!” Tuna pronounced. Tuna then raised his own sword ready to finish it.

“I’ve failed,” Brondan thought, “I don’t deserve to live.” Brondan closed his eyes waiting for the end.

Out of nowhere, Sydnee charged out and screamed, “Stop! I’ve told you I wanted him alive!”

“Sorry, maiden. I got a higher pay to finish him. Now get out of my way,” Tuna replied, blasting Sydnee away with the hilt of his sword.

“NOBODY TOUCHES HER!” Brondan suddenly screamed as he jumped up from the ground. Filled with rage, Brondan’s hair exploded into a golden color and formed a powerful aura around him. Tuna stepped back stunned.

“I AM THE  LEDGENDARY NINJA GOD! AND YOU SHALL DIE!” Brondan roared. Then he blasted Tuna with rows and rows of rockets demolishing Tuna. Tuna fainted. Brondan turned back to his normal form and went towards Sydnee.

“You sent him!” Brondan yelled, “Why?”

Sydnee looked at him angrily, “This isn’t over Brandyxkillr,” and disappeared.

Meanwhile... Fernandi and his group of friends laid cowering in fear as they were about to be smashed by android lasers.

*Will Sydnee stop Brondan? Will Trish live? What will happen to Fernandi and his group? Finally, WHERE”S RYAN?????*
