The next day, Fernandi and the rest of the group woke up shivering crazily. The cold was so intense; it was a miracle that none of them had gotten frostbite or hypothermia. However, Ryan’s shell was covered in ice. It was so cold that their barf froze into icicles. As they marveled at the amazing masterpiece, they noticed that it was creepily silent. Not even the winds made any noise. After putting on some warm layers, they nervously continued on their journey. 

Fernandi whistled to keep himself interested as they continued to move forward. Unfortunately, the quiet didn’t last long. A harsh blizzard came out of nowhere blinding and freezing the adventurers. Fernandi squealed in fear.  Before the friends could even find shelter, they were stopped by a ferocious polar bear that seemed unaffected by the weather. The polar bear leaped at the handicapped friends. Fernandi crawled away barely escaping the claws of the bear. In panic, Fernandi grabbed Ryan and smashed his icy shell on the growling bear. The ice cracked and the bear fainted. 

Ryan woke up and said, “What’s for breakfast?” 

Fernandi replied, “You missed it,” tossing him a granola bar, “and I think the Evil Enchantress of the East isn’t that bad. She only sent us a snowman and a bear. I’ve met worst.”

“Don’t insult her!” David yelled, but it was too late. A killer wind knocked down all of the friends on their butts and before they knew it, penguins were all surrounding them.

Fernandi gulped, “You don’t think these are just nice and cuddly, regular penguins, right?” The penguins bared their abnormally sharp teeth in response.

Fernandi whispered, “Run.” All of them sprinted for their lives as the evil, savage, bloodthirsty penguins waddled after them. It was no use. There was no escape and no chance of fighting. These penguins outnumbered the friends 100 to 1. The penguins stared at the paralyzed friends with hunger and savagery. 

“Please don’t eat us,” Bill whimpered. Then the penguins charged. Before Fernandi could even wet his pants (which he did), the penguins engulfed the poor group ripping their flesh off like pieces of fish. 

Fernandi yelled into his earphone desperately, “Anybody! Help! SOS!” 

The earphone replied, “Sorry, no connection. Please try later.” Fernandi cussed as he tried to evade from the killer penguins. Each group member fought with all their might and will power but it was hopeless. Fernandi threw bottles of alcohol oil wine and smashed it on penguins’ faces; Bill threw banana bombs; Ryan bit the penguin’s toes; David pressed his fighting mode and started running penguins down. However, the efforts to save their lives were all in vain. The throng of penguins overwhelmed the group as the penguins piled in.

“This can’t be happening!” Fernandi gasped as a penguin pulled him down trying to poke his eyes out.

“Mommy!” Ryan wailed as he tucked in his shell as the penguins tried to eat him unsuccessfully.

“AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!” Bill screamed as the penguins ripped off his tin head to find flesh. 

“Somebody save us!” David cried as he drowned in penguins. This seemed like the end for these unfortunate people. 

However, the earphone crackled in Fernandi’s ears, “We’re coming as fast we can Fernandi! Hold on!” Trish yelled.

With that motivation Fernandi shouted a war cry and jumped up and started punching penguins for all he’s worth.

“FireStar and Robin are coming!” Fernandi yelled. With renewed hope, the team regrouped and tried to fend off the enraged hungry killer penguins. They threw fists, beer, donuts, bananas, pastries, bombs, Hot cheetos, and snowballs. However, it was a matter of time before the brave friends fell again. Trish and Izrael needed to come quickly or there won’t be anything to save, but bones.

Meanwhile... Trish and Izrael were speeding towards the location to save the friends. Little did they know, the Evil Enchantress of the East was expecting them...

Izrael and Trish could already hear the commotion of the battle, but before they could jump in, they were stopped by a force field. 

“How do we get in?” Trish yelled as she fired starbolts at the invisible force field.

“You don’t” hissed a voice behind them. 

“Who are you?” demanded Izrael as he turned around.

“Your worst nightmare,” the monster screeched as it leaped out striking the heroes. It was a Cobra-Chicken. This certain one was named Alejandri (it wasn’t the Dark Magician; the Dark Magician just liked the name Alejandri). The two heroes fought back trying to destroy the monster. The quick creature , with a snake body and chicken legs and head, slithered back and forth dodging the couple’s attacks.

Meanwhile... Fernandi and his friends were being cornered into the mountain. There was no hope of surviving.

“This is the end!” Fernandi cried. The friends looked at each other and said a silent goodbye and embraced themselves for the worst. A casual observer (or any observer) would say that this was a pretty gruesome and sad ending and would agree that there was no more hope of surviving, but they were wrong...

A big blur of blue zoomed in front of the cowering friends and vaporized the front row of penguins. The penguins behind them met a similar fate. The blur was shooting spells and snowballs and sonic speed knocking out the penguins like bowling pins. In a matter of seconds, their laid nothing in front in them except the carnage of vaporized killer penguins. The blur soon stopped being a blur and there stood, the Wizard of Oz. 

“This is the last time I am helping you. The Dark Magician is going against me and I barely came here in time to save you. The next time you’re in trouble, I will be most likely be battling one of the Dark Magician’s strongest minions or the Dark Magician himself. This means you’re on your own now. Bye!” said Robert as he poofed away.

“Come back!” Fernandi yelled, “Why can’t you just bring us home?!” 

Firestar and Robin rushed over. As soon as the penguins disappeared, Alejandri retreated and the force field vanished. 

“You’re early,” David grumbled sarcastically. 

“It’s not our fault. There was a force field stopping us and a Cobra-Chicken was trying to kill us!” Trish protested.

“No matter,” Fernandi said, “our next challenge will be even harder. We need to stick together. Are you coming with us?” Trish and Izrael agreed. Then they all went to the bar (drinks were on Trish) and all fainted in unison.
