Fernandi woke up feeling like poop. He took a sniff of himself and started vomiting on himself, not making the pit smell any better. Then he tried to get out of the pit, but it was too deep. He cried for help, but there was no response, except for the rustling leaves. Then, out of nowhere, the poop-like sand started to suck Fernandi downwards. Fernandi then, in panic, struggled and pushed with all his might. Instead of getting out or unstuck, he went deeper into the pit. In addition to panic and terror swelling up inside Fernandi, he felt like the ground was eating him. There was great pain in his legs as he sank down into the carnivorous hole. Soon, his head was the only thing left visible. Everything else was in the poop.

In tears, Fernandi whined, “Of all the ways to die! I get to drown in a stinky hole of feces!”
 
“You can’t go anywhere without out me can you?” said a voice from above. Then a vine was thrown down.

“Ryan?” Fernandi asked.

“Of course it’s me, now grab the rope!” Ryan commanded.

“Um, I have no hands,” Fernandi commented.

“Use your teeth. Like me,” Ryan answered.

“Where are the others? They probably could save me better.” Fernandi gurgled.

“They’re not here obviously! So bite the rope!” screamed the exasperated turtle. Feeling hopeless, Fernandi bit the rope. Suddenly, with a tremendous yank that almost ripped Fernandi’s teeth out, Fernandi flew out of the pit. 

“You’ve got strong teeth,” Fernandi said in astonishment. 

“Thanks. I take teeth vitamins,” Ryan replied. Then the duo continued on their destination.

“Where are the others?” Fernandi asked. Based on Ryan’s pained expression, Fernandi could tell things weren’t going well. 

“Trish got squashed by Twinkies. Robin got bombarded with penguins. David got captured by Alejandri. And Bill got beat up by gorillas.” Ryan answered.

“Oh. Are they dead?” Fernandi asked. 

“I don’t know,” Ryan whimpered. The two friends continued to walk in silence. Then they heard a growling voice behind them. They turned around and what they saw was so horrifying, so terrifying, so scary, so frightening, so appalling, so horrendous, so sickening, so shocking, and so gruesome, that it required a whole new chapter to write about.
