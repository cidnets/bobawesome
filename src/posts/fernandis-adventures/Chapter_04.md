Fernandi woke up with a loud fart and an aching body. Then Fernandi walked to his destroyed motorcycle. He kicked it and the motorcycle roared into life. There was no sign of destruction or scratch on the motorcycle. Fernandi stepped back stunned. 

Then a turtle stepped out of nowhere and said “Don’t be surprised. It was me who fixed your bike. It is just a little thank you for killing that savage snake. Oh, by the way my name is Ryan.” Fernandi was eternally grateful for the turtle and responded, “Thank you  very much. Hey, do you want to be my sidekick on my quest to save a gorgeous princess named Suzzana. You  get free beer.” The turtle agreed and they went off merrily on their quest. Then before they could even make it to the city, a big monster stepped in front of them.  Fernandi whined, “What is that  ugly thing and why are monsters trying to kill me?!”

Ryan the turtle calmly said, “ I believe that is the Minotaur from Greek mythology. He is half man, half bull.” Fernandi thanked him for the facts and they started to panic. Fernandi threw a bottle wine at the Minotaur which made it drunk. Then the monster went on a rampage and started to charge at the duo with rage. Ryan hid in its shell and Fernandi got an idea. He slid the shell at the charging Minotaur with accuracy. The Minotaur slipped and fell on his head and his horns got stuck in the cement. Fernandi fed the Minotaur some leftover wine jam causing the Minotaur to vaporize. Finally Ryan and Fernandi celebrated with a feast of Heineken. They both fainted.
