"Imbecile!" the voice snarled, and Alejandri slammed to the ground, writhing in pain. His body was covered in burns and bruises.

"Please, Master! I don't know what happened. The whole place just exploded! Just give me another chance! I know where he went! He went to the turtle! He has no one else."

"You think I don't know that!" the Dark Wizard roared. "It is no matter. I knew you would fail anyway. I have sent in my greatest creation to destroy this pest and his stupid turtle. He shall no longer torment me with his presence. He will pay for what he has done to me and my former plans of world domination." Then, the Dark Wizard, underneath his pitch black hood, began to smile.

"Actually, I will torture this fool till his death. He will be brought to me and be forced to watch his whole planet be taken over. I am a genius!" The Dark Wizard gave his best evil laugh, causing everyone in the castle to get the chills and want to hide in the corner and cry. "Then, I will kill him."

"But, Master. I don't think that is a good idea. The hero always escapes and saves the day someh-" Before Alejandri could finish his insightful thought, he found himself dangling over a pit of lava.

"Noooooo! Please, Master! I was just kidding! It's a brilliant idea! Let me live! I will do anything! Ple-e-e-ase!" The Dark Wizard looked over at his bathroom and scrunched his nose.

"In that case, you may live. But you are now dismissed from your commanding position and I do not want to see you again."

"But my family has served you generations, sir! We have been your most loyal followers." The Dark Wizard reopened the lava pit threateningly.

Alejandri gulped and bowed. "As you wish, Master."

"Now go clean this whole place up. I want everything to be spotless before my world domination plans are complete." Turning towards his shining ball of omnipotence, the Dark Wizard took off his hood and grinned. "Nothing can stop me now."
