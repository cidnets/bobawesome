title: "Chapter 2: Turtle with Chicken Noodle Soup"

---

“Aaaaaaaahh!!!!” Fernando screamed in terror. However, instead of finding himself in heaven (or hell), Fernandi realized that he was on a comfy bed.

“Holy cow," Fernandi groaned in relief, taking in his cozy surroundings gratefully. "It was all a dream. Thank God.” Fernandi started crying with joy. At this point, a familiar-looking small green turtle, the size of a pencil box, waddled through the door with a bowl of soup on its shell. Fernandi stared at the turtle in disbelief. 

“Unfortunately, it wasn’t a dream, bro,” the turtle said nonchalantly, handing Fernandi some chicken noodle soup. Taking the soup with trembling fingers, Fernandi slumped back into his bed, continuing to cry (not from happiness).

“It’s okay, dude. We can win this together,” Ryan the talking turtle encouraged.

“No we can’t!” bawled Fernandi. “There’s nowhere to go. We have no one to turn to! And how am I even alive? Did you save me?”

Ryan nodded. “Yeah, you were toast without me. Luckily, I got Roberto’s SOS signal in time. I was able to swoop in and save the day.”

“No, really, how did you save me?”

“I bombed the whole place,” Ryan said coolly.

“What? You bombed the whole place? How? And how did I get out alive?”

“Everywhere you went, Roberto rigged the place up with magical explosives just for an occasion like this, and when he gave you that invisibility spell, he also made you invulnerable against the blast. Where is Roberto anyway?”

Fernandi looked down in shame, “He’s gone. He died when my house blew up.”

“Wow...we really are screwed then,” Ryan said, “Let’s get going. We need to gear up and take out the threat once and for all.”

“Gear up? We can’t do that, Ryan. I’m not who you think I am anymore. I know you and I have defied death countless times, but I don’t have that ability anymore. I am no longer a drunk, almost-naked, homeless man with incredible skills of defeating the odds and evil villains. Those days are behind me. Besides, didn’t you kill them all with that bomb? Let’s just get out of here and hide somewhere. I know some places.”

“That’s not an option anymore, man. Roberto has been hiding your trail ever since ‘The End’. Without him, there is nothing to hold them back. Also...never mind. The point is that we need destroy these forces of evil, just like old times.”

“You’re holding something back. What is the real reason we have to do this?”

“Well, since your retirement, Roberto knew that The Dark Wizard would come back stronger than ever, and when he did, you would be the first one he goes after. After you… the world.” Fernandi dropped to the floor.

“The Dark Wizard is still alive! And he wants to take over the world? Just great. Just great,” Fernandi sighed, pacing back and forth, “I don’t think we can do this alone. Is the rest of the group available?”

Pulling a laptop out of his shell, Ryan said, “I think it’s just us. The rest of them are stuck in Oz. We’re on our own.” Fernandi rubbed his face with his hands and took a deep breath.

“Okay. Let’s do this. Let’s do this for Roberto. Let’s go kick some butt, one last time.”

Ryan smiled and pointed with gusto, "To the Batmobile!"

"We have a Batmobile?"

"Of course we don't. Who do you think I am? A multibillionaire? Let's go to the shed and get ready for our awesome quest to save the world."
