"Am I dead now?" Fernandi said unsteadily as he rolled out from a bed.

"Nope," Ryan stated frankly.

"Can you elaborate? Like, where are we and what happened after we flew into the portal?"

"Once we flew through the portal, we landed right in front of the police department in Ozland, which was probably not where the Dark Magician wanted to land. The good news is that the police were able to save us, but the bad news is that the Dark Magician managed to escape."

"Wait, what about BlackStar and Alejandri? And all those monsters on Earth?"

"When the government realized that all of its resources were being sucked away magically, they pinpointed the location and took over the spot. The whole army showed up. They most likely killed all the monsters and took Alejandri and BlackStar into custody. However, the details aren't very clear. It's hard to get information about other dimensions, but I'll keep you updated."

"Okay. Now the big question. What do we do now?"

"Well," Ryan pondered for a second, munching on some granola bars, "We can't go home right now. But we can continue the fight to defeat the Dark Magician.  And this time, we have friends." One by one, the whole gang walked into the room.

"So are you in?" Ryan asked.

Fernandi grinned, "It doesn't really seem like I have any other option, but ... I'm in."

After the confirmation, everyone partied and ate nachos. Then everyone got drunk and fainted. Just like old times, just like old times...
