Fernandi woke groggily, finding himself strapped to a chair. Sitting next to him was Ryan, who was also strapped to a chair. The turtle was happily smacking on some gum.

"Where are we? What happened? Are we dead? Can I have some gum?" Fernandi spewed at Ryan.

" In the Dark Magician's lair.  We blacked out from explosion. Not dead yet. Have nothing on me right now," Ryan answered calmly.

Fernandi struggled against the confines of his chair.  "We need to get out of here, Ryan! The world depends on it!"

"Fighting till the end as always. Refusing to give up even when the odds are stacked against. Completing impossible feats," boomed a faraway voice. "Unfortunately, it seems your luck has run out my friend. You have no more allies to rescue you and no more tricks up your sleeve. It is the end of the world and the end of you."

"Who says I don't have any more tricks?" Fernandi yelled defiantly, "I stopped you once before. There's no reason why I won't stop you now. It'll be a walk in the park!"

Stepping into the light, the Dark Magician snickered, "It doesn't look like you'll be doing any stopping behind those magical restraints."

“Anyway, it seems you have already met my latest creation! Say hello again, BlackStar!" the Dark Magician announced as the girl swooped into view. "I used your own friend Trisha's DNA to create my own sidekick! She comes in handy when I need to get a task done. I also taught her some dark magic, which amplified her power greatly."

"You cloned her?" Fernandi clarified.

"Yes, I cloned her, you moron," the Dark Magician sighed. "Anyway, the only reason I have kept you alive is for you to witness the destruction of your planet."

The Dark Magician cackled and pointed to the thousands of suddenly visible TV screens surrounding them. "Look at the screens, Fernandi. Do you see all the resources I'm sucking out of this planet? I've decided that this planet is too boring to take over. Humans here are too stupid and violent. Instead, I'm taking everybody’s energy and resources to create myself a portal back to Ozland so I can take it over once and for all!"

"I won't let you!" Fernandi screamed, pushing his restraints with all his strength.

"Of course you won't," the Dark Magician chuckled, "Your presence here is an annoyance now. Kill them." With that order, the Dark Magician glided away, laughing in glee at the death of his enemies and imminent victory that would occur within seconds. BlackStar smiled evilly and floated forward.

"What do we do?" Ryan squeaked and farted, who finally realized the gravity of the situation and was starting to have intestinal problems. Fernandi's mind raced with options and ideas, none which made sense or was helpful.

"I don't know!" Fernandi cried desperately. Then it clicked.

"Um. Ryan, are you still chewing the gum that was from my pocket?"

"Possibly," Ryan said sheepishly.

"Then, swallow it! I think you might be able to blow off the restraints with your explosive farts!" Fernandi whispered urgently. Ryan made a disgusted face, but did as he was told. "Hurry up! She's getting closer!"

"Then, stall her!" Ryan raged as he made a constipated-looking face. However, stalling was not necessary, for at that moment, Ryan flatulated. The fart reverberated across the whole castle, shattering glass and causing everyone to drop to the ground. Unfortunately, Ryan still sat stuck in the chair.

"Well, I guess this is the end, buddy," Fernandi sighed.

"I don't think so!" Ryan yelled, letting out turtle-warrior cry. In that instant, an explosion blasted Ryan and Fernandi from their seats, as well as knocking out any nearby guards. BlackStar, who managed to block the deadly fart explosion, glared at the two free prisoners in shock. Raising her fists, she rained lasers at them, aiming to kill. Relying on his incredible reaction speed and Ryan's shell, Fernandi did a 360 degree black flip rebounding the lasers right into BlackStar's face and ultimately knocking her out. Still holding Ryan, Fernandi sprinted towards the Dark Magician, who was currently unaware of the escape and about to step through the portal to Oz.

"Give back our resources!" Fernandi yelled. With all his might, Fernandi flung himself against the machine and the Dark Magician.

The Dark Magician raised his arm in the air stopping Fernandi and Ryan midair. "Valiant try. But it is now time for you to di--!" Before the Dark Magician could finish speaking, Fernandi chucked Ryan right into the Dark Magician's face.

Not expecting it, the Dark Magician fell to the ground and knocked over his fancy world-destroying laptop. Immediately, everything started to flash red.

"Returning All Resources" blared across the sound system.  

"NOOOO!!" bellowed the Dark Magician, reaching for his laptop to cancel the order.

"Oh no, you don't!" cried Fernandi, lunging at the fallen Dark Magician. Ryan, who was still farting, jumped onto wrestling match biting everything that was not Fernandi. A great struggle ensued; both sides at a deadlock. Knowing that he and Ryan could not keep up the wrestling forever, before the Dark Magician unleashed a spell or the guards came back, Fernandi screamed, "ONE MORE FART, RYAN! SHOOT US INTO THE PORTAL!"

"I can't!" Ryan grunted. The Dark Magician, realizing what was happening, became more vigorous in his wrestling, only managing to shoot sparks from his hands due to his lack of focus.

"We can't hold him much longer! You need to fart one more time! Do it for your smashed golden great-grandfather!" Fernandi gasped as the Dark Magician punched him in the gut.

Channeling the inspirational statement, Ryan farted.

And with that, all three were launched through the closing portal.
