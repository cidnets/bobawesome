Fernandi woke up with an exploding headache from his hangover. Fernandi quickly shook it off and drank a liter of Coke to refresh himself. Then Fernandi remembered that he was on a quest, so he jumped on his motorcycle driving off to the next stop. As Fernandi drove naked to the next destination, he pondered of who could be this beautiful princess, named Suzzana. As he daydreamed, Fernandi slipped off his motorcycle crashing onto the ground with a thud. Luckily, Fernandi lived with only some bruises and scratches. However, the motorcycle didn’t experience the same fate. It blew up as soon as it flipped 20 feet in the air and smashed into a old tree. Fernandi stared at his beloved motorcycle mournfully as he angrily munched a granola bar plastic and all. Then Fernandi noticed that it was nighttime. 

“I guess I have to spend the night under this old tree” Fernandi grumbled. As he got ready to sleep, a snake slithered down a tree and started to strangle Fernandi. Surprised Fernandi bit into the fat constrictor. The constrictor squeezed harder in response. Before Fernandi blacked out, he saw his extra-strength whiskey bottle on the ground. One drop of that stuff could even knock out a fully grown blue whale. Fernandi kicked it making it fly into the the snakes nostril and mouth. The snake dropped dead instantly. Then it swelled up until it was as big as the tree and exploded out jam. It whiskey flavored jam. After eating a whole jar of it, Fernandi fainted.
